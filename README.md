This is an `R` package for estimating [irregular
histograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Variable_bin_widths).
The intention is to:

1.  Implement some methods for selecting bin placement,
2.  Make the interface mimic `stats::hist` as closely as possible.

Currently the package estimates the optimal bin placements of irregular
histograms (given the number of break points) using either maximum
likelihood or L<sub>2</sub> minimization.

*Note:* This package is under development. The API and core features are
likely to change.

## Installation

Install the development from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/histogramr")
```

## Example Usage

Only data on the unit interval \[0, 1\] is supported.

``` r
library("histogramr")
histogramr(USArrests$Rape/100, breaks = 7)
rug(USArrests$Rape/100)
```
