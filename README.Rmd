This is an `R` package for estimating [irregular histograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram#Variable_bin_widths). The
intention is to:

1. Implement some methods for selecting bin placement,
2. Make the interface mimic `stats::hist` as closely as possible.

Currently the package estimates the optimal bin placements of irregular 
histograms (given the number of break points) using either maximum likelihood 
or L<sub>2</sub> minimization. 

*Note:* This package is under development. The API and core features are likely 
to change. Still, it passes the CRAN checks `histogramr` plots histograms, so
use if you really want to.

## Installation

Install the development from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonasMoss/histogramr")
```
## Example Usage

Only data on the unit interval [0, 1] is supported.

```{r example}
library("histogramr")
histogramr(USArrests$Rape/100, breaks = 7)
rug(USArrests$Rape/100)
```
